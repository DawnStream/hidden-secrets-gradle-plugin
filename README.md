# Gradle plugin to deeply hide secrets on Android

This repository is the gradle plugin version of this POC : [HiddenSecrets](https://github.com/klaxit/HiddenSecrets)

It is highly inspired from https://www.splinter.com.au/2014/09/16/storing-secret-keys/

It uses a combination of obfuscation techniques to do so :
- secret is obfuscated using the reversible XOR operator so it never appears in plain sight,
- obfuscated secret is stored in a NDK binary as an hexadecimal array, so it is really hard to spot / put together from a disassembly,
- the obfuscating string is not persisted in the binary to force runtime evaluation (ie : prevent the compiler from disclosing the secret by optimizing the de-obfuscation logic).

‚ö†Ô∏è Nothing on the client-side is unbreakable. So generally speaking, **keeping a secret in a mobile package is not a smart idea**. But when you absolutely need to, this is the best method we have found to hide it.

## This is a kotlin gradle plugin
This project is also a demonstration on how to create a full Kotlin gradle plugin for Android projects.

## Compatibility
This gradle plugin can be used with any Android project in Java or Kotlin.


## Integrated in Klaxit's production application
The `HiddenSecretsPlugin` is already used by our Android application : [Klaxit - Covoiturage quotidien](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wayzup.wayzupapp).
This is a french carpooling app that let our users share there rides to work or other location. 265 companies and 30 client cities are trusting us by using our carpooling solution.
We are using this plugin to secure keys that we want to hide from easy attacks based on apk extraction and reverse engineering.
This is why this repository will be well maintained by our engineering team to ensure **Klaxit**'s Android app security.

# 1 - Install the plugin

Get the latest version of the plugin from [releases](https://github.com/klaxit/hidden-secrets-gradle-plugin/releases).
Copy `HiddenSecretsPlugin-0.1.0.jar` to your Android project in `/app/libs/` folder.

Add these lines in your app level `build.gradle`:

```gradle
buildscript {
    // Folder app/libs/ will be crawled
    repositories {
        flatDir { dirs 'libs' }
    }
    // Add dependency to HiddenSecretsPlugin
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.klaxit.hiddensecrets.gradle:HiddenSecretsPlugin:0.1.0")
    }
}

android {

    ...

    // Enable NDK build
    externalNativeBuild {
        cmake {
            path "src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt"
        }
    }
}

...

// Apply HiddenSecretsPlugin to the project
apply plugin: 'com.klaxit.hiddensecrets'
```

Then sync your Android project.

# 2 - Hide secret key in your project

Obfuscate and hide your key in your project :
```shell
gradle hideSecret -Pkey=yourKeyToObfuscate [-PkeyName=YourSecretKeyName] [-Ppackage=com.your.package]
```
The parameter `keyName` is optional, by default the key name is randomly generated.
The parameter `package` is optional, by default the `applicationId` of your project will be used.

# 3 - Get your secret key in your app
üëè You can now get your secret key from Java/Kotlin code by calling :
```kotlin
// Kotlin
val key = Secrets().getYourSecretKeyName(packageName)
```
```Java
// Java
String key = new Secrets().getYourSecretKeyName(getPackageName());
```

# 4 - (Optional) Improve your key security
You can improve the security of your keys by using your own custom encoding / decoding algorithm. The keys will be persisted in C++, additionally encoded using your custom algorithm. The decoding algorithm will also be compiled. So an attacker will also have to reverse-engineer it from compiled C++ to find your keys.

As an example, we will use a [rot13 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) to encode / decode our key. Of course, don't use rot13 in your own project, it won't provide any additional security. Find your own "secret" encoding/decoding algorithm!

After a rot13 encoding your key `yourKeyToObfuscate` becomes `lbheXrlGbBoshfpngr`.
Add it in your app :
```shell
gradle hideSecret -Pkey=lbheXrlGbBoshfpngr -PkeyName=YourSecretKeyName
```

Then in `secrets.cpp` you need to add your own decoding code in `customDecode` method:
```cpp
void customDecode(char *str) {
    int c = 13;
    int l = strlen(str);
    const char *alpha[2] = { "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"};
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < l; i++)
    {
        if (!isalpha(str[i]))
            continue;
        if (isupper(str[i]))
            str[i] = alpha[1][((int)(tolower(str[i]) - 'a') + c) % 26];
        else
            str[i] = alpha[0][((int)(tolower(str[i]) - 'a') + c) % 26];
    }
}
```

This method is automatically called and will revert the rot13 applied on your key when you will call :
```kotlin
Secrets().getYourSecretKeyName(packageName)
```

## Other available commands
Unzip `.jar` file in `/build/` temporary directory :
```shell
gradle unzipHiddenSecrets
```

Copy required files to your project :
```shell
gradle copyCpp
gradle copyKotlin [-Ppackage=your.package.name]
```

Create an obfuscated key and display it :
```shell
gradle obfuscate -Pkey=yourKeyToObfuscate [-Ppackage=com.your.package]
```
